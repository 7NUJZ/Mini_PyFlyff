# 🔧 Alt Controller Fix Guide

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED!**

Your Alt Controller issue has been fixed with the new **simplified browser targeting system**.

## 🎯 **What Changed**

### Before (Complex - 6 browser selections):
- Default, LA, GT, Alt Controller, Macro Loop, Buffer
- Alt Controller was using "Default" setting (confusing)
- Too many options, hard to manage

### After (Simple - 2 browser selections):
- **LA Buffer**: Its own browser selection
- **Other Features**: Shared by GT, Alt Controller, Macro Loop, Buffer
- Alt Controller now clearly uses "Other Features" setting

## 🚀 **How to Fix Your Alt Controller**

### Your Current Setup:
```
- Default: Firefox ❌ (old system)
- LA: Focused Window ✅
- GT: Firefox ❌ (old system)
```

### New Simplified Setup:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Browser Targeting                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ LA Buffer: Focused Window           │ ← For LA only
│ Other Features: Firefox             │ ← GT, Alt Controller, Macro, Buffer
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Setup Steps:
1. **Open the new Mini PyFlyff** (from dist folder)
2. **Set "LA Buffer"** to "Focused Window"
3. **Set "Other Features"** to "Firefox"
4. **Save configuration** (Menu → Save Config)
5. **Test Alt Controller** - it should work now!

5. **Keys should appear in Firefox** ✅

### If Still Not Working:

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### For Reliable Alt Controller:
1. **Use "Focused Window"** for maximum compatibility
2. **Keep target window focused** when testing
3. **Configure simple hotkeys** first (like 'a', 'b', 'c')
4. **Test in a text editor** to verify key sending works

### For Multi-Boxing:
1. **Set "Other Features" to your alt's browser**
2. **Set "LA Buffer" to your main's browser**
3. **Both will work independently**

## 🎉 **You're All Set!**

- ✅ **GT Buffer** → Targets "Other Features" browser
