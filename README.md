# Mini PyFlyff
A mini version of PyFlyff for Mozilla FireFox. This tool has the Alt Control feature from PyFlyff and a better Mini Ftool.

# What do I need to use this tool?
You need to install Mozilla Firefox web browser to be able to use this tool, download it from their official site: https://www.mozilla.org/

# Tutorial on how to use it:
- Separate every key with commas ",".

- Separate every timer with commas ",".

- Click the "Save Key(s)" button to save your current keys.

- To Start/Stop the Mini Ftool loop, press the "Start/Stop" button.

**Here is an example of configuration:**

- Alt Control Key(s): 1,2,3,4,5

This means that whenever you press either 1,2,3,4 or 5, it will then send those keys to your Alt Client.

- Mini Ftool Key(s): f1,f2,f3

This means that when you start the Mini Ftool loop, it will then send those keys sequentially to your Alt Client.

- Mini Ftool Key(s) Timers: 1,5,10

This means that after the first key is pressed, there will be 1 second delay for the second key to be pressed, which will then have a 5 seconds delay to press the third key, which will then, finally, have 10 seconds delay to start over.

Checking the "Make Timers Random" checkbox, will make it so there will be a random number that will be generated between 0 and the number you choose.

**Following the previous example we have:**

- A number between 0 - 1.

- A number between 0 - 5.

- A number between 0 - 10.
