## üí° Features (New and Improved!)

### **Alt Controller**  
The original **"Alt Control"** has evolved into **Alt Controller**!

- Set up hotkeys in Alt Controller to control your alt character with ease. Actions taken on your main character will automatically reflect on your alt‚Äîperfect for combining your alt's Heal with your main's AoE!

### **Macro Loop**  
The feature formerly known as **"Mini Ftool"** is now **Macro Loop**!

- Set up hotkey sequences to spam with customized delays.
- Toggle "Random Delays" to add a unique touch between each key press for a more natural feel.

### **Buffer**  
The beloved **Buffer** feature is now here!

- Simply set your buff hotkeys, activate the GT Buffer, and it‚Äôll keep your buffs up and running!
- Easily toggle the Macro Loop and Buffer via shortcuts‚Äîno need to open the tool each time!

‚ú® **Hover over text fields, buttons, and labels for quick tooltips that explain each feature.**

## ‚ùó Not for Sale!
