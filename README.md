# Mini PyFlyff
A mini version of PyFlyff for Mozilla FireFox. This tool has all the old and loved features of PyFlyff but renewed and new ones!

# What do I need to use this tool?
You need to install Mozilla Firefox web browser to be able to use this tool, download it from their official site: https://www.mozilla.org/

Also, you must play with your alt through Mozilla Firefox, since this tool was made specifically to send keystrokes to Mozilla Firefox.

# Features (old and news)

**"Alt Control" became now "Alt Controller".**

**The best feature of PyFlyff is also here!**

You can setup hotkeys to control your Alt in the Alt Controller. Each hotkey pressed on your Main, will be pressed in your Alt Client as well. Very good if you want to combine your Alt's Heal with your Main's AoE in one single hotkey!

**"Mini Ftool" became now "Macro Loop".**

You can setup a hotkey spammer in the Macro Loop to spam one or a sequence of hotkeys. You can also setup delay(s) for each hotkey interaction.

You can check the "Random Delays" checkbox to generate random 
delays between each hotkey press from the Macro Loop.

**Mini PyFlyff has a Buffer now!**

**A feature that everyone loves, is now part of this tool!**

Configure the hotbar of your buffs and their hotkey. Activate the GT Buffer to always keep that GT UP!

You can setup shortcuts for Macro Loop and Buffer, so you don't have to go to the tool and manually start/stop them!

Hovering your mouse above the text fields, buttons and labels, will show a small tooltip explaining what each feature does.

# Disclaimer

Bots/Macros are forbbiden by the Devs. One for one macro are always valid since it still an one button for one action. Well, as you can see, Mini PyFlyff (as well as the old PyFlyff) are able to perform more than just one action per key and also have automatic features (hotkeys spammers) etc. Use this tool well! Do not fully afk with this tool, do not leave your RM on full auto with this tool! You may be caught off guard by a GM and receive a ban! You have been warned.

# This tool is not for sale!

This tool is free and opensource, and will always be! I like to create little python automation projects because I learn a lot from them! IF SOMEONE IS TRYING TO SELL THIS TOOL, THIS PERSON IS A SCAMMER!
