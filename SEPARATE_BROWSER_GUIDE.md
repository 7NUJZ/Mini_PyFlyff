# Separate Browser Targeting Guide

## üéØ Overview

Mini PyFlyff now supports **separate browser targeting** for different features! This means you can:

- **LA Buffer** ‚Üí Send keys to Opera GX
- **GT Buffer** ‚Üí Send keys to Chrome  
- **Alt Controller** ‚Üí Send keys to Firefox
- **Macro Loop** ‚Üí Send keys to Edge
- **Buffer** ‚Üí Send keys to any browser

Perfect for **multi-boxing** setups where you want to control multiple characters in different browsers simultaneously!

## üöÄ Quick Setup Example

### Scenario: Control Two Characters
- **Main Character** in Opera GX (LA Buffer)
- **Alt Character** in Chrome (GT Buffer)

### Setup Steps:
1. Open Mini PyFlyff
2. In the "Browser Targeting" section:
   - **LA**: Select "Opera GX"
   - **GT**: Select "Chrome"
   - **Default**: Select "Focused Window"
3. Configure your buffers:
   - **LA Buffer**: Set hotkey (e.g., "f") and delay (e.g., "45")
   - **GT Buffer**: Set hotkey (e.g., "g") and delay (e.g., "30")
4. Save configuration: Menu ‚Üí Save Config

### Result:
- LA Buffer will automatically send "f" key to Opera GX every 45 seconds
- GT Buffer will automatically send "g" key to Chrome every 30 seconds
